UIColourSelector.lua
--------------------

The UIColourSelector is an object used to select colours.

	Note, the width and height of this object are rounded to the nearest multiple of the ratio
	This means that if you have a ratio of 1 (4/4), and set the width to 9, the width will actually become 8

	UIColourSelector( number x, number y, number width, number height )
		- creates a colour selector object

	(Callback) UIColourSelector:onSelect( number colour )
		- called with the colour the user pressed

	(number) UIColourSelector.ratio
		- the ratio of columns to rows of the colour selector
		- supported ratios are 1/16, 2/8, 4/4, 8/2, 16/1
		- using an unsupported ratio will result in an error
